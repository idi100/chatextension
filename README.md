Chatgpt Guard Chrome Extension

This is a project about my first Chrome extension.

Problem: Earlier this month, I submitted my resume to ChatGPT, asking to check for errors or improvements. The only problem was that I accidentally entered personal information, such as my address, phone number, full name, and school. This made me very paranoid because, one, it could easily happen again, and two, I don't know where my information went or who could see it.

Solution: I had the idea of creating a Chrome extension that blocked any sensitive information from being typed into chat. The only problem was that I had no idea where to start. So after watching and reading about Chrome extensions, I stumbled upon this: https://www.sitepoint.com/create-chrome-extension-10-minutes-flat/ which was exactly what I was trying to build... While it was already built, it still needed some improvements.

Improvements:
The original extension did not work if the information was copied and pasted; I made sure the filter worked regardless.
